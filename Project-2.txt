Part-I: Examine the data

1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.

select count(1)
from ticket_details;



2.) Find out how many unique states, the cars which got parking tickets, came from.

select count(distinct Registration_State)
from ticket_details



3.) Some parking tickets don’t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. 
Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
select count(1)
from 
ticket_Details 
where Street_Code1 ='' or Street_Code2='' or Street_Code3=''



Part-II: Aggregation tasks

1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
select Violation_Code,cnt
from 
(
select Violation_Code,count(1) as cnt
from ticket_Details
group by Violation_Code) temp 
order by cnt desc
limit 5;



2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)

select Vehicle_Body_Type,cnt
from 
(
select Vehicle_Body_Type,count(1) as cnt
from ticket_Details
group by Vehicle_Body_Type) temp 
order by cnt desc
limit 5;

select Vehicle_Make,cnt
from 
(
select Vehicle_Make,count(1) as cnt
from ticket_Details
group by Vehicle_Make) temp 
order by cnt desc
limit 5;







3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)
		
		select Violation_Precinct
		from 
		(
		select Violation_Precinct,count(1) as cnt
		from ticket_Details
		where Violation_Code<>0 
		group by Violation_Precinct
		) temp 
		order by cnt desc
		limit 5;
	  
      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
	  
	  select Issuer_Precinct
		from 
		(
		select Issuer_Precinct,count(1) as cnt
		from ticket_Details
		where Violation_Code<>0 
		group by Issuer_Precinct
		) temp 
		order by cnt desc
		limit 5;
	  
	  
4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?
		
		select Violation_Code,cnt
		from 
		(
		select Violation_Code,count(1) as cnt
		from ticket_Details
		where Issuer_Precinct in (
			select Issuer_Precinct
					from (		
							select Issuer_Precinct,count(1) as cnt
							from ticket_Details
							group by Issuer_Precinct
						) temp
						order by cnt desc
					limit 3		
						)
		group by Violation_Code
		) temp 
		order by cnt desc
		limit 5;
		
		
		


5.) Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
	
	
select unix_timestamp(concat(Date_First_Observed,Violation_Time,'yyyyMMddhhmma'))
from ticket_Details;
	


6.) Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT bins_of_time,
             Violation_Code,
             ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY bins_of_time ORDER BY cnt DESC) AS rnk
      FROM (SELECT bins_of_time,
                   Violation_Code,
                   COUNT(1) AS cnt
            FROM (SELECT *,
                         CASE
                           WHEN hour_part >= 1 AND hour_part <= 4 THEN 'group_1'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 5 AND hour_part <= 8 THEN 'group_2'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 9 AND hour_part <= 12 THEN 'group_3'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 13 AND hour_part <= 16 THEN 'group_4'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 17 AND hour_part <= 20 THEN 'group_5'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 21 AND hour_part <= 23 THEN 'group_6'
                           WHEN hour_part = 0 THEN 'group_6'
                         END AS bins_of_time
                  FROM (SELECT *,
                               SUBSTR(parsed_datetime,12,2) AS hour_part
                        FROM (SELECT *,
                                     from_unixtime(unix_timestamp (concat (Date_First_Observed,Violation_Time,'yyyyMMddhhmma'))) AS parsed_datetime
                              FROM ticket_Details) TEMP) temp2) temp3
            GROUP BY bins_of_time,
                     Violation_Code) temp4) temp5
WHERE rnk <= 3;






7.) Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day (in terms of the bins from the previous part)

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT bins_of_time,
             Violation_Code,
             ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Violation_Code ORDER BY cnt DESC) AS rnk
      FROM (SELECT bins_of_time,
                   Violation_Code,
                   COUNT(1) AS cnt
            FROM (SELECT *,
                         CASE
                           WHEN hour_part >= 1 AND hour_part <= 4 THEN 'group_1'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 5 AND hour_part <= 8 THEN 'group_2'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 9 AND hour_part <= 12 THEN 'group_3'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 13 AND hour_part <= 16 THEN 'group_4'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 17 AND hour_part <= 20 THEN 'group_5'
                           WHEN hour_part >= 21 AND hour_part <= 23 THEN 'group_6'
                           WHEN hour_part = 0 THEN 'group_6'
                         END AS bins_of_time
                  FROM (SELECT *,
                               SUBSTR(parsed_datetime,12,2) AS hour_part
                        FROM (SELECT *,
                                     from_unixtime(unix_timestamp (concat (Date_First_Observed,Violation_Time,'yyyyMMddhhmma'))) AS parsed_datetime
                              FROM ticket_Details
                              WHERE Violation_Code IN (SELECT Violation_Code
                                           FROM (SELECT Violation_Code,
                                                        COUNT(1) AS frequency
                                                 FROM ticket_Details
                                                 GROUP BY Violation_Code) inner_query                              

) TEMP) temp2) temp3
            GROUP BY bins_of_time,
                     Violation_Code) temp4) temp5
WHERE rnk <= 1;




8.) Let’s try and find some seasonality in this data
      a.) First, divide the year into some number of seasons, and find frequencies of tickets for each season. (Hint: A quick Google search reveals the following seasons in NYC: Spring(March, April, March); Summer(June, July, August); Fall(September, October, November); Winter(December, January, February))
	  
	  
	  SELECT season,
       COUNT(1) AS frequency
FROM (SELECT *,
             CASE
               WHEN mon IN ('03','04','05') THEN 'Spring'
               WHEN mon IN ('06','07','08') THEN 'Summer'
               WHEN mon IN ('09','10','11') THEN 'Fall'
               WHEN mon IN ('12','01','03') THEN 'Winter'
             END AS season
      FROM (SELECT *,
                   SUBSTR(Date_First_Observed,5,2) AS mon
            FROM ticket_Details) TEMP) TEMP 2
GROUP BY season  
	  
	  
      b.)Then, find the 3 most common violations for each of these seasons.
	  
	  SELECT *
FROM (SELECT season,
             violation_code,
             ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY season ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rnk
      FROM (SELECT season,
                   violation_code,
                   COUNT(1) AS frequency
            FROM (SELECT *,
                         CASE
                           WHEN mon IN ('03','04','05') THEN 'Spring'
                           WHEN mon IN ('06','07','08') THEN 'Summer'
                           WHEN mon IN ('09','10','11') THEN 'Fall'
                           WHEN mon IN ('12','01','03') THEN 'Winter'
                         END AS season
                  FROM (SELECT *,
                               SUBSTR(Date_First_Observed,5,2) AS mon
                        FROM ticket_Details) TEMP) TEMP 2
            GROUP BY season,
                     violation_code) temp3) TEMP 4
WHERE rnk <= 3;
